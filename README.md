## Implement API calls using axios in a Next.js application.
 * Fetch data dynamically based on route parameters (e.g., property ID).
 * Handle loading and error states in React components.
 * Submit form data to an API endpoint (POST requests).
 * Display API-fetched data dynamically in UI components.
 * Connect multiple pages and components to different API endpoints.

## Learning Outcomes
 * After completing this milestone, learners will be able to:
 * Replace hardcoded property, booking, and review data with dynamic API calls.
 * Build reusable components that can handle asynchronous data.
 * Manage form submission processes with real-time validation and success/error feedback.
 * Ensure the UI updates correctly when data is loading, successfully fetched, or fails to load.
 * Use dynamic routing in Next.js to fetch and render data based on route parameters.
 
## Key Concepts
 * Dynamic Data Fetching – Loading real data from APIs instead of static files.
 * REST API Integration – Using GET and POST requests to interact with backend services.
 * Dynamic Routing in Next.js – Fetching content based on router.query parameters.
 * Loading & Error Handling – Providing user feedback while fetching data or handling failures.
 * Reusable Components – Designing components that adapt to dynamic data.
 * Form Submission to API – Sending user input securely to backend endpoints.
 
## Tools & Libraries
* Next.js – For server-side rendering and dynamic routing.
* React Hooks (useState, useEffect) – For managing component state and lifecycle events.
* Axios – For making HTTP requests to the API.
* TypeScript – For type safety and a better development experience.
* Tailwind CSS – For styling the components.

## Real-World Use Case
* This milestone simulates how modern booking platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, or Expedia fetch and update their data in real time. Instead of loading static content, these applications request live data from servers for each property, booking, or review. The skills learned here are directly applicable to building production-grade applications that rely on APIs to serve up-to-date information, process reservations, and collect user-generated feedback.
